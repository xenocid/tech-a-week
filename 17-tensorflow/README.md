Week 17. 2016/04/24-2016/04/30 TensorFlow

[ TensorFlow ](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a new hot machine-learning 
library and it will be my first 'guinea pig' for the tech-a-week project.
I didn't spend a lot of time selecting it, basically just looked at the last
bookmark I put in my Pocket and felt like that would be the right choice since I
wanted to look at it for quite a while at this point.
