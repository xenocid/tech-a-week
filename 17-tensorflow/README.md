Week 17. 2016/04/24-2016/04/30 TensorFlow

[ TensorFlow ](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a new hot machine-learning 
library and it will be my first 'guinea pig' for the tech-a-week project.
I didn't spend a lot of time selecting it, basically just looked at the last
bookmark I put in my Pocket and felt like that would be the right choice since I
wanted to look at it for quite a while at this point.

What I'd like to do with it is to build a web app that allows me to input a url for the web page, then it will compare that web page with pages that I have in my Pinboard, find the most similar ones and suggest me the tags based on the tags for those existing pages in the Pinboard and the similarity metric. It may be a bit ambitious, but should be an interesting and even moderately useful.
